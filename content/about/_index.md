I am an independent datacenter operator, network engineer, and software developer building distributed systems using Rust, Erlang and Elixir. I live in the Colorado mountains, outside of the Denver metro.

I cover a variety of topics on this website. You can find trials and tributes of a small scale network operator, challenges faced by an independent datacenter operator, and journals on my software development journeys. I also cover daily life, and give business insight that might be okay sometimes.

I am an advocate for libre software and the support efforts of the [FSF](https://gnu.org), and you should be one too. Also checkout the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/)

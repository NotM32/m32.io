I like to hear from new people. While my bandwidth is at a premium, I will get back to you if you write. You can reach me through email, [hello@m32.io](mailto:hello@m32.io) - I will do my best to get back to you in a timely manner.

You can find links to my professional accounts and socials at the footer. Check me out on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/m32), [GitHub](https://github.com/notm32/), and [X](https://x.com/m32_io)

## PGP
I make frequent use of PGP and [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org). PGP is a great technology, and I am pleased to support it. It's unfortunate that the global climate has thrust these tools into a position of necessity.

Unless compromised, my PGP key fingerprint will always be `DE0F E946 DDA3 4B3B D1F9 2D59 E017 B967 AC29 E321`. You should see this key  fingerprint present in various correspondence with me, including email, business cards, about me fields and more. I will sign emails with either this key or a [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) provided key which I have signed/trusted using my primary key.

My most up to date public key can be imported from [m32.io/pgp](/pgp)

You may use this key to send me encrypted mail, or to verify statements which I have made signatures on.

## Messaging
I am available on Signal. Please reach out to me via email to obtain this information. This is my preferred messaging platform, and it should be yours too if it isn't.

I am willing to adapt however, and can also be reached on
- WhatsApp
- Telegram
- Wire

## Conferences

I've really enjoyed attending these in-person events. [NANOG](https://nanog.org) has really been impactful for me. Attending through the ARIN fellowship as a long time lurker of the NANOG mailing list was an exceptional experiance and I'd advise anyone at any stage in their career to attend these meetings if they're trying to broaden their network.

I aim to be a frequent attendee of [NANOG](https://nanog.org), where travel costs permit.

This year, I attended [ARIN54](https://arin.net/arin54) in Toronto as an ARIN Fellow. I try to attend these policy meetings virtually at the very least, in person when convenient.

I am planning to attend [PTC](https://ptc.org) next year.

I'd love to hear from others in the community about these types of events. I am Denver local, but willing to travel anywhere in the content/country for these types of events. If you have any suggestions for me, I'd love to hear them. If you'd like to meet at one of these, let's plan on it.
